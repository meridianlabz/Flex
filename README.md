# Flex
> A modern responsive template for Joomla 3+

Websites today are viewed using a various number of different types of digital devices from smartphones to smartwatches to everything in-between. Good web designers of this modern day are therefore tasked to construct their websites to adapt to each of these devices and their varying screen sizes. This phenomenon has brought forth a process called [_Responsive web design_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design). 

**Flex** is a responsive Joomla template built from scratch. You can use it as a starting point for designing your very own Joomla (version 3.0+) template that will adjust automatically to both large and small screens.

## How To Use
To use the Flex template in your joomla site, simply do the following:

- Clone this repository 
- Go to your joomla administrator backend (http://yourwebsite.com/administrator)
- Browse to the extensions install section
- Install "flex.zip" ...found inside your cloned Flex repository
- Set "flex" as your default template

## Building blocks

[**Joomla - version 3.0+**](http://joomla.org)  
Of course you are going to need to have a running installation of the Joomla CMS, preferrably version 3 and above. This Joomla installation will help you to test your template in a real website CMS environment.

[**Foundation front-end framework**](http://foundation.zurb.com)  
For a while now, Foundation has been my go-to frontend framework when I want to rapidly prototype a responsive user interface design for the web.  
In a few words, Foundation is a responsive UI framework used to design complex, device-agnostic front-end layouts.   
It comes with these cool features: _flexible grid system, re-useable interface elements (like buttons, tooltips, alert boxes...), visibility classes (to show / hide elements at different screen sizes) and so many more..._

**HTML, CSS, JavaScript**  
You will need knowledge of the fundamental web technologies to be able to build this template.
